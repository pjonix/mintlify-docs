## About Me

Hi, I'm **Hio**. I bridge the gap between education and technology.

As a **Teaching Lead** at an International School, I specialize in mathematics and physics education, guiding students through rigorous curriculums like DSE, AP, and A-Levels.

As an **AI Development Enthusiast**, I build tools to enhance productivity and educational experiences.
